# NLP Project – Sentiment Analysis & News Classification

## 📌 Overview

This repository includes two natural language processing (NLP) projects:

1. **IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**  
   Goal: Predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.  
   Tools: NLTK, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest  
   Dataset: IMDb (50,000 reviews)  
   📄 Report: `imdb_sentiment_analysis.pdf`

2. **News Article Classification**  
   Goal: Automatically classify news articles into categories (e.g., Politics, Sports).  
   Tools: TF-IDF, Label Encoding, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest  
   Dataset: HuffPost News  
   📄 Report: `news_article_classification.pdf`
